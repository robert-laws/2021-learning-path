## The Internet

The internet is a global system of connected devices, routers, and modems. Most connections to the internet are through an ISP (Internet Service Provider). Individuals connect to the internet as clients through their computer/device and an ISP. Data is transferred in smaller units from a whole called packets that are reassembled and delivered. Routers help direct traffic on the internet to its proper destination.
