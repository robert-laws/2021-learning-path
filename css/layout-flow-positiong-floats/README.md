# CSS Layout - Flow, Positioning, Floats

Browsers come with default ways to handle the layout of elements on a webpage.

#### Normal Flow

Browser control of layout is also known as **Normal Flow** and determines how elements display within the webpage and relate to the layout and positioning of other elements on a webpage. Understanding normal flow is useful for understanding how different elements behave on a webpage and what properties need to be modified to make changes to normal flow.

An important aspect of the normal flow of elements on a webpage is whether or not they will flow next to other elements and remain on the same line - also known as `inline` elements - or if they will take up an entire like just to themselves - also known as `block` elements.

For example, elements such as the `<div>`, `<p>` and `<li>` elements are block elements and will take up an entire line to themselves and push subsequent elements to a new line in the flow of the page.

By contrast, elements such as `<strong>`, `<em>`, and `<span>` are inline elements and will flow next to each other in the same line on the page.
