## Promises

There are many times when an operation in a program or on a webpage is requested, but the results of the request aren't immediately available for further processing. In cases like these, the operation is considered to be asynchronous. To handle this specific situation more smoothly, JavaScript has an object called a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that represents the eventual completion or failure of the asynchronous operation and provides the means for programmers to work with asynchronous operations and data.
