## Functions

Functions are segments of code that can be defined and then called when needed. Functions are helpful since they allow a programmer to write functions once that can then be used multiple times, reducing code duplication. Functions also allow programmers to create discrete segments of code that can logically separated from other code.

Functions include the following characteristics:

- Can accept none or multiple parameters
- Can return none or a value at the end of the function call
- Can produce an effect on other parts of the program without needing to return a value
