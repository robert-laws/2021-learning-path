# WordPress: Understanding the New Paradigm - Notes

## The Present

### Key Terminology

**Block** - self-contained individually configurable content block describing the contents within

**Block Editor** - The editing interface where you add, configure, and add content to blocks

**Gutenberg** - The codename of the block editor and development project.

### Embracing Blocks

Blocks were introduced in 2018 with WordPress 5.0. The classic editor still works and is still available. There are three groups of WordPress users - Classic Editor, ClassicPress, or WordPress Blocks.

Phase One - Block editor replaces Classic Editor, turning content blobs into collections of blocks.

Phase Two - Full-site editing, where blocks migrate from the content area to every area of the site (header, footer, sidebar, etc).

### Working with Blocks

Core Blocks - The core blocks are the most commonly used blocks. They are the ones that are most commonly used in the Classic Editor. All HTML elements have equivalent blocks.

### The Block Library

Block-Level library - The block library is a collection of blocks that can be used in the block editor. Blocks that are not part of the core library can be added to the block library via an external plugin specifically for blocks.

### Block Suites

Block suites are single libraries that add multiple blocks and maintain a consistent look and feel. Together, the individual blocks making up the suite can also add advanced functionality and work in combination with each other. Often a lot of overlap between blocks in a suite and core blocks.
